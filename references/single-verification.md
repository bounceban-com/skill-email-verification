# Single Verification

Verify one email address at a time. Three endpoints:

1. **Waterfall endpoint** - one synchronous request, recommended for Clay, n8n and similar services.
2. **Standard endpoint** - 15-second timeout, then async via polling or webhook.
3. **Status endpoint** - poll for an async result.

---

## Waterfall single verification (recommended for Clay / n8n)

```
GET https://api-waterfall.bounceban.com/v1/verify/single
```

**Note: different base URL** (`api-waterfall.bounceban.com`). Holds the connection open until the result is ready (default 80 s, configurable). No separate polling call needed. If it times out with HTTP `408`, send the same request again - retries within 30 minutes of the initial request for the same email don't deduct credits.

### Parameters (query)

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `email` | string | Yes | The email to verify. |
| `mode` | string | No | `regular` (default) or `deepverify`. |
| `url` | string | No | Webhook URL to receive the result via HTTP POST. Event header: `event-type: single.email_verification_finished`. |
| `timeout` | integer | No | Timeout in seconds, 30-300, default 80. Must not exceed your own service's timeout limit. |
| `disable_catchall_verify` | string | No | `0` (default) or `1`. When `1`, only basic SMTP verification runs; catch-all/SEG-protected emails return `result: "unknown"`, `score: -1`, cost 0 credits. |

### Example request

```bash
curl "https://api-waterfall.bounceban.com/v1/verify/single?email=dev@bounceban.com" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Example response (200)

```json
{
  "id": "wf502abcde",
  "status": "success",
  "email": "dev@bounceban.com",
  "result": "deliverable",
  "score": 99,
  "is_disposable": false,
  "is_accept_all": false,
  "is_role": true,
  "is_free": false,
  "mx_records": ["alt1.aspmx.l.google.com", "aspmx.l.google.com"],
  "smtp_provider": "Google",
  "mode": "regular",
  "verify_at": "2022-11-16T07:21:24.943Z",
  "credits_consumed": 1.0,
  "credits_remaining": 375214.0
}
```

### Timeout response (408)

```json
{
  "id": "8416f480",
  "error": "Verification timeout",
  "message": "The email verification request timed out after 80 seconds. Please submit the email again. You won't be charged for resubmitting the same email within 30 minutes of the initial request."
}
```

On `408`: retry the same request. Retries within 30 minutes are free.

## Standard single verification

```
GET https://api.bounceban.com/v1/verify/single
```

15-second timeout. If verification finishes in time, the full result is returned. Otherwise the response contains `status: "verifying"` and an `id` - get the final result by polling `/v1/verify/single/status` or via webhook (`url` parameter).

**Costs 1 credit per request, even for the same email.** Never resubmit while `status` is `verifying` or `queue`.

### Parameters (query)

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `email` | string | Yes | The email to verify. |
| `mode` | string | No | `regular` (default) or `deepverify`. |
| `url` | string | No | Webhook URL for the result. Event header: `event-type: single.email_verification_finished`. |
| `disable_catchall_verify` | string | No | `0` (default) or `1`. See waterfall endpoint above. |

### Example request

```bash
curl "https://api.bounceban.com/v1/verify/single?email=dev@bounceban.com" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Example response - finished (200)

```json
{
  "id": "502abcde",
  "status": "success",
  "email": "dev@bounceban.com",
  "result": "deliverable",
  "score": 99,
  "is_disposable": false,
  "is_accept_all": false,
  "is_role": true,
  "is_free": false,
  "mx_records": ["alt1.aspmx.l.google.com", "aspmx.l.google.com"],
  "smtp_provider": "Google",
  "verify_at": "2022-11-16T07:21:24.943Z",
  "credits_consumed": 1.0,
  "credits_remaining": 375214.0
}
```

### Example response - still verifying (200)

```json
{
  "id": "502abcde",
  "msg": "The email verification process is not yet complete.",
  "status": "verifying",
  "try_again_at": 1731286696
}
```

`try_again_at` is the recommended Unix timestamp for the next poll.

## Get single verification result (poll)

```
GET https://api.bounceban.com/v1/verify/single/status
```

Free - does not cost credits. Results available for 90 days.

### Parameters (query)

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Yes | The `id` returned by `/v1/verify/single`. |

### Polling rules (important for agents)

- Cap polling at **10 requests per `id` per 5 minutes**.
- After 5 minutes with no result, stop polling and start a new verification request.
- Prefer webhooks over polling: pass a `url` parameter in the original `/v1/verify/single` request.

### Example request

```bash
curl "https://api.bounceban.com/v1/verify/single/status?id=502abcde" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Responses have the same shape as `/v1/verify/single` above (`success` or `verifying`).

## Error responses (all single endpoints)

| HTTP status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `400` | Invalid parameter. |
| `401` | Authorization missing or invalid. |
