# Check API

Quickly check basic information about an email or domain **without SMTP verification**: domain type (work / free / disposable), username type (personal / role), and syntax validity. Useful for blocking disposable emails at sign-up or free emails on demo-request forms.

**Cost:** 1 credit per successful request from your **Check Plan** - a separate balance from verification credits. Check balances: https://bounceban.com/app/account/billing

### Response fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | string | `success` or `error` (on `error`, try again). |
| `domain_type` | string | `work` (business domain), `free` (e.g. gmail.com), or `disposable` (e.g. 001xs.org). |
| `username_type` | string | `personal` (e.g. john@) or `role` (e.g. sales@). Only returned when an email was submitted. |

### Error responses

| HTTP status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |

| `401` | API key missing or invalid, IP address not whitelisted, or account blocked - see `msg`. A disabled or expired key also returns `401`, with `error` set to `api_key_disabled` or `api_key_expired`; an account whose email has not been verified gets `error: account_not_activated`. |
